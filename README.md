# Smart Traffic

This is a participant project for the A1 problem of the 9th China Software Cup College Student Software Design Competition. We were asked to build such a system which is capable of:

- Object Detection & Tracking on Vehicles
- Traffic Violation Detections on Vehicles, including:
  - Running a red light
  - Switch lanes against regulations
  - Park illegally
- Traffic counting at crossroad
- Chinese Car Plates Detection
- Speed Estimamtion on Vehicles

We are second-class prize winner of A1 problem group of CnSoftBei2020, which holds a top 10% position out of hundreds participants.
